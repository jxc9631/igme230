    <p>Hotel LaBonte is a historic hotel in Douglas, Wyoming, United States. Built in 1913-1914, 
    it was part of the town's early 20th century building boom, the result of new railroad and road connections.
     Local investors engaged the Baerresen Brothers of Cheyenne and Denver as architects, and contractor 
     Edward Reavill erected the three story brick structure. It had electrical lighting, steam heat and 
     telephones in 54 guest rooms. The U-shaped hotel is on a corner lot at the intersection of North 
     Second and Walnut Streets in downtown Douglas. Projecting wings facing Walnut Street flank a recessed 
     courtyard that accommodates the hotel's entrance. The dining room occupies the ground floor of the east 
     wing, and two storefronts occupy the west wing on the corner. The lobby has a tiled floor, a beamed 
     ceiling and decorative columns. Windows were replaced during renovations in 1967 and after a 1981 fire.<span id="1b">[2]</span></p>
    
    <p>The hotel's name was chosen for its association with bountifulness, and in honor of the reputed first
     resident of Converse County, Pierre LaBonte.<span id="3">[3]</span> Hotel LaBonte was placed on the National Register of 
     Historic Places on October 10, 2008.<span id="2a">[1]</span> The hotel was renovated for a third time in 2015. It remains 
     in operation as a hotel.<span id="2b">[2]</span></p>
